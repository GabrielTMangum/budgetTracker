<h1>Progressive Budget App</h1>

<p>This project was an attempt at creating PWA that tracks a user's expenses and income online and offline.  I used a service worker that enabled that offline functionality. </p>

<p>The greatest challenge I faced was trying to get my mind wrapped around what a PWA is and if I can even achieve it.  I used activities from the noSQL and PWA Modules and that's it</p>
